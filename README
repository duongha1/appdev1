# this is the first version
This project is to run a Raspberry PI as an audio device. The device is able to do 2 functions: as a sound collector and as a test-tone generator.

1. Configuation Instructions

The application is running on a Raspberry Pi 3 model B. This Pi should come with a USB sound card, a network connection, a microphone.

-----------------------------

1.1.a Configure USB sound card as default audio device

.Basically, RPi onboard sound card does not have microphone interface, so we need to change the default audio device to be USB sound card. 
.Boot up RPi, and apply the USB sound card. To ensure your USB sound card is mounted, you can use “lsusb” command. 
.Use “sudo nano /etc/asound.conf” command and put following content to the file:

pcm.!default {
  type plug
  slave {
    pcm "hw:1,0"
  }
}
ctl.!default {
    type hw
    card 1
}

.Go to your home directory. Use “nano .asoundrc” command and put the same content to the file.
.Run “alsamixer” you should be able to see that USB sound card is the default audio device. For a more sensitive sound detection, it is better to maximize the volume of “Mic”.

-----------------------------

1.1.b Software Configuration

.The newest version of Raspbian (a.k.a. Jessie) comes with a new version of alsa-utils (1.0.28), which has a bug while recording. To fix this problem, we have to downgrade alsa-util to an earlier version (1.0.25).
.To downgrade alsa-ultis, use “sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list” command and add the last line.
.Run “sudo apt-get update”
.Run “sudo aptitude versions alsa-utils” to check if version 1.0.25 of alsa-util is available
.Run “sudo apt-get install alsa-utils=1.0.25-4” to downgrade
.Reboot (if necessary)
.Run “arecord -r44100 -c1 -f S16_LE -d5 test.wav” to test that your microphone is working. You should see a “test.wav” file in the current folder.
.Put earphone on the USB sound card. Run “aplay test.wav” to check that your recording is okay.

-----------------------------

1.2 Install Libcurl library

Here are instruction to install libcurl library:

.Firstly, use command "ls /usr/include/curl" or "ls /usr/include/arm-linux-gnueabihf/curl" to identify that libcurl library is installed.
.If the folder does not exist, then running “sudo apt-get update” to update the application list.
.Run “sudo apt-get install libcurl3” to install the libcurl3.
.Run “sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev” to install the development API of libcurl4.

-----------------------------

2. Installation Instructions
.Insert the SD card - install Raspbian OS via website "https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/"
.Download "Noobs" image and ZIP file
.If this is the first time bootin, plug in your keyboard, mouse and monitor cable. Then, you disable a display with RPi
because it will be more convinient and you do not use it in most cases. Furthermore, you also need to know its IP address 
when using RPi remotely. For more information about NOOBS setup, finding at: https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/2/
.Disassemble keyboard, mouse and monitor cable and plug them back in your computer.
.Insert USB sound card and microphone to the Raspberry Pi and connect RPi to a Internet domain by the RJ45 cable. 
.Connect to power supply by Micro USB to USB cable. 	
.Using IP address sent by email to connect to the terminal.

-----------------------------

3. Operating Instructions

.Open the PUTTY terminal and logging in your IP address.
	login as: pi 
	password: "enter your password"
.Use "cd appdev1/ " command to access to "appdev" folder where all the source code files are put in.
.Here are commands to get access to those file:
	+"mkdir": Make a new folder
	+ "ls -l": show the files of current folder in details 
	+"cd..": Change to parent folder
	+"cd $HOME": Change to the root folder of current user
	+"rm": Delete a file or a number of files/folders
	+"scp": Copy files from one host to another host
	For more information, finding at: http://www.circuitbasics.com/useful-raspberry-pi-commands/
.Use "make" command to compilling program
.Use "./sound.out" command to run program
.Using the microphone to sense the movement and the variation of the sound movement and find how many peaks the audio device reaches.

-----------------------------
